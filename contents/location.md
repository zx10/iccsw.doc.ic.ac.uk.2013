Located in the center of London, South Kensignton Campus is well served
by a public transport.

### By Air

**From Heathrow Airport**
Take the Underground train (Piccadilly Line) to either South Kensington
or Gloucester Road stations (approximately 50 minutes journey time).

**From Gatwick Airport**
Take a British Rail train to Victoria station (journey time 40 minutes)
and then by Underground train (Circle or District Line - westbound) to
either South Kensington or Gloucester Road stations (approximately 5
minutes journey time).

Both airports are some distance from central London and a taxi is not
recommended for the whole journey. If you do choose to take a taxi you
are advised to establish the cost before you get in.

### By Underground (Metro)

Travel to either South Kensington or Gloucester Road stations, which are
on the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines.

The London Underground is the most convenient way of getting to South
Kensington Campus by public transport, and to and from the airports,
main-line train stations etc.  Unless your journey is one-off you are
strongly advised to purchase an [Oyster
Card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do), which is a pre-pay
card that you can use on all London underground and overground trains
and buses.  An Oyster Card avoids the need to queue for tickets and
dramatically reduces the cost of each journey.  You can obtain an Oyster
Card in advance or can purchase one at most underground stations.

### By Bus

The following buses stop near the South Kensington Campus:

* Royal Albert Hall: 9,10 or 52
* Victoria and Albert Museum: 74 or 14

London bus map](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/centlond.pdf).

### On Foot

From South Kensington station either follow the subway signposted to the
museums or walk north up Exhibition Road. The main entrance to the
College is just past the Science Museum. To get to the Huxley Building
from here go through the main entrance and follow the elevated walkway
to the far end; this enters the building on level 3. From Gloucester
Road station walk north up Gloucester Road and turn right at Queen's
Gate Terrace; the entrance to the Department is opposite the end of
Queen's Gate Terrace, on Queen's Gate itself. Both stations are about a
five-minute walk from the campus.
