The third Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to
provide an international forum for doctoral students in computing. While
most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific
research areas, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines
in computer science to submit papers and take part in the event. It is a
workshop organised by students for students. The workshop will be hosted
by the [Department of Computing](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at
[Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

The workshop offers:

* a traditional track featuring technical papers focused on current
topics in computer science
* a poster session
* a tools and demos session

#### Technical Track

This track is a general computing track for both theoretical and
applied approaches. Areas of interest for the technical track cover
all fields of research in computer science.

#### Tools and Demos Track

Submissions to the tools and demo track are to describe novel
tools implementing interesting theory. Papers documenting tools
with real-world applicability are particularly encouraged to submit.
It is expected that any tool paper will have an accompanying demo.

#### Poster Session

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to share and
discuss new ideas and interesting preliminary work. Posters will
be displayed throughout the entire workshop giving presenters a
unique opportunity to discuss their work, get exposure and receive
feedback from attendees. All students who have a paper accepted
for the workshop are welcome, but not required, to submit the poster.

### Submission

Submissions for the technical track, and tools and demos track
are limited to 8 and 6 pages respectively in [OASIcs format]. For
each submitted paper, the authors will be required to review at
least two other submissions, not necessarily related to the topic
of their immediate expertise. To ensure reviews are objective and
meet academic standards the steering committee will look at all
reviews prior to their release.

To submit a poster, please submit a draft of your poster, in PDF
(A1 size), together with an extended abstract (up to 2-page) by
Friday, August 23, 2013, 11:59 p.m. BST. Poster
submissions must include the authors’ names, affiliations, and contact
information. Authors are not required to print their own posters;
the workshop committee will handle this and also cover the cost
of the print.

Papers that do not comply with the submission requirements,
including length and format, may be rejected without review. Submission of
papers and posters should be done via EasyChair at
<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccsw2013>.

All accepted technical and tool papers of ICCSW’13 will be published
in the [OpenAccess Series in Informatics
(OASIcs)](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics) published
by Schloss Dagstuhl. It is expected that one of the paper authors
will attend the conference and present their work. Electronic copies of the
proceedings will be made available for all participants at
the time of the workshop.

### Registration

Registration is free of charge for all students. Some student bursaries,
funded by industrial sponsors, will be made available to students with
submissions accepted in the workshop. We aim to provide financial
support for students who otherwise would be unable to attend.

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to share and
discuss new ideas and interesting preliminary work. Poster presenters
will have the entirety of the evening reception to discuss their work,
get exposure and receive feedback from attendees. All students who have
a paper accepted for the workshop are welcome, but not required, to
submit the poster.

### Organisation

The local steering committee will consist of research students from the
department, who will be responsible for the organisation of the
workshop. Research students from outside Imperial College are invited to
become members of the organising committee as ambassadors of the
workshop in their respective university to promote and coordinate
students wishing to participate in the workshop.
The current list of organising committee members can be found in the
[Organisation](/2013/organisation.html) page.
